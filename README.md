# A private API for Kard ban interaction


I did this by accident, I wanted to do a private api of my Wiz lamp but I haven't succeeded yet. and so, I wanted to look at my bank app..
I'm posting on Github today to show you how easy it is to control a Kard bank account, without much more security than that...
